# CACHE_CPU_AFFINITY - hex mask to indicate which CPU we're allowed to run on
# for example a value of 0x01 indicates run on CPU 0
#                        0x02 indicates run of CPU 1
#                        0x04 indicates run on CPU 2
#                        0x03 indicates run on either CPU0 or CPU1
# This configurable CPU affinity is bounded by the 
# SOLACE_SOLCACHEINSTANCE_CPU_MASK environment variable.
# i.e.  export SOLACE_SOLCACHEINSTANCE_CPU_MASK="0x07" will limit solcache
# instance to running on CPUS 0,1,2.  Hence the actual processor run on will
# be CACHE_CPU_AFFINITY & SOLACE_SOLCACHEINSTANCE_CPU_MASK
# if this results in an empty set, the process fails to start. 
# (Non re-loadable parm, only read on startup) 
# helpful hint: "ps -eo pid,psr,comm" will show which processor we're actually
# running on
